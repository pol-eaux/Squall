Squall: Sudden Violence

Very rough outline of intended features / ideas

Story fragments to be improved later
Retelling of the Noachian flood story from Genesis.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative
Endless rain creates a muddy, flooded environment.
Everyone seems possessed or super violent crazy like in Condemned.
They are turning crazy from the influence of the Devil’s Tower.
The player will make his way towards the Devil’s Tower (Wyoming), the picture in mind is a huge red eclipsed sun just above the tower
The player will kill a representation of the devil that was making everyone crazy in a mine dug into the base of the tower.
God is flooding the earth because of evil, killing the source of evil stops the rain.

Enemies
Small fast moving enemy, quick but deals low damage.
Regular enemy
Heavy enemy, slow but deals high damage
Dynamiter, low physical damage but throws dynamite at the player.
All melee enemies can spawn with a random melee weapon, or grab items from the environment like in Condemned.
Enemies can spawn with random clothing pieces to show variety.
I’m not sure if I want enemies to have guns, with how I want to balance guns I think it would be too hard for the player to kill an enemy with a gun? This could change idk
Bosses
The Devil
Try to find a good representation, a goat kinda seems overdone.
Flood the mine to kill him
Ned Kelly type armorer enemy
Make him walk into traps to kill him

Player Mechanics
Health and stamina
The max health cap can be increased for the day by eating a wholesome meal before bed. Eating grains, proteins, a side, and a drink constitutes a whole meal.
The max stamina cap can be increased for the day by drinking a cup of coffee in the morning.
Tobacco can be used to slowly restore health during the day.
Stamina naturally regenerates over time.
Stamina is expended with melee and unarmed attacks
Stamina is also expended when running or fighting in mud and water.
Safe Room and Saving
The safe room is at the end of each level, where the player can reload his pistol, eat dinner, and sleep to continue to the next day and level.
Saving is only done during sleep.
At the beginning of the next day the player can make coffee in the safe room.
Inventory
The player has an inventory in the form of his torso, looking down the player can see the playermodel torso.
His gun can be drawn by placing the crosshair on the holster, and holstered by doing the same.
Picking up food, drink, coffee, and tobacco will not have a visible inventory, you can pick up a limit for each.
Picking up ammo supplies also does not have a visible inventory, you can pick up as many as you want because they will be scarce.
There are inventory upgrades that can picked up:
Knife sheath, allows you to store one knife on your person.
Dynamite pouch, allows you to store one or two sticks of dynamite on your person.

Combat
Very much inspired by Condemned and Chivalry.
Unarmed Combat:
Kick
Block
Left Swing
Right Swing
Jab
Overhead
Melee Combat: Melee weapons can be picked up in the environment, but all melee weapons break quickly to encourage players to use their surroundings.
Left Swing
Right Swing
Stab
Overhead
Throw
Block
Extra damage for certain melee types for certain attacks
E.g. knives do more stab damage, axes do more slash damage, blunt do more overhead damage.
Some melee weapons have combos
E.g. bottles do more slash and overhead damage, this breaks the bottle and leaves the neck, which does more stab damage.
Pistol: The pistol is like a special ability, you cannot reload except in the safe room (it is too wet outside), but it kills in one to two shots.

Fire
